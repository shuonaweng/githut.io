## Overview

This is a sample report based on Class Performance analysis of a Midterm exam. It visualizes performance statistics, explores root causes and common mistakes, and recommends area to improve. It helps course instructors to understand students' progress on the course and gives them insights to adjust teaching plan if needed. 

## Senario

As a Teaching Assistant, I often mark exams for course instructors. Midterm exam is a good way to check students' understanding of knowledge taught, as well as takeaways on teaching plan. Therefore, it's important to knowing how does it go. To provide a quick overview of Class performance in the exam, I recently create a wonderful report with Power BI.
