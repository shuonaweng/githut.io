## Overview

This is a sample report based on Class Performance Analysis of a Midterm exam. It visualizes performance statistics, explores root causes and common mistakes, and recommends areas to improve. It helps course instructors to understand students' progress on the course and gives them insights to adjust teaching plans if needed. 

## Senario

As a Teaching Assistant, I often mark exams for course instructors. Midterm exam is a good way to check students' understanding of the knowledge taught, as well as takeaways for teaching plans. Therefore, it's important to know how it goes. To provide a quick overview of class performance in the exam, I recently created a wonderful report with Power BI.
